      "startDate": "2022-03-31",
      "summary": "Cloud computing enables companies to quickly build scalable distributed systems without large initial capital expenses. Cloud service providers offer computing resources on-demand with a pay-as-you-go pricing strategy. Those resources can be used in a broad range of different fields, from factory automation and monitoring to complex shopping websites. Some of the cloud services are considered “serverless”, meaning the underlying infrastructure is hidden from the user and managed by the cloud platform. Those services are typically unique to their cloud platform and require platform-specific knowledge and configuration. However, limiting an application deployment to only one cloud platform has various disadvantages, such as vendor lock-in. There is no well-established universal standard for describing a cloud architecture that uses serverless services and can be deployed to multiple cloud platforms. The offerings of different cloud platforms often contain services that are similar in function but vastly different in usage and configuration, which is especially true with serverless products. This abstraction barrier is the reason why developing the same application for different platforms is expensive and time-consuming. We propose a solution to this problem by providing a way to describe high-level cloud architectures in a generic, platform-independent way. Furthermore, a software tool that translates this generic architecture into platform-specific architectures is presented. These contributions enable developers to build applications that target multiple cloud platforms more efficiently.",

Conventional input devices like a mouse or a keyboard are made for two-dimensional environments. They require complex movements to complete tasks in a three-dimensional environment.\n\nMost people own a smartphone that they use on a daily basis. Such phones have a variety of different sensors already built-in, feature wireless capabilities, and are able to run custom software. This makes them affordable general-purpose devices. A virtual representation of the phone can be displayed in a Virtual Environment using the orientational sensors. Therefore they are suitable to use as interaction devices for Virtual Reality.\n\nIn this thesis, three interaction examples are presented to verify that a smartphone can be used as an input device for Virtual Reality. A model viewing application, a pointing tool, and a virtual keyboard were implemented and evaluated.",
